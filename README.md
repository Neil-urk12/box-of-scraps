# Box of Scraps

These are the templates I made **for myself** but can be extended depending on your requirements and use-case. 

# Backend
- **[initsia](https://github.com/Neil-urk12/initsia/)** : An elysia.js server with simple JWT authentication, Database Adapter Interface for extensibility and a concrete MySQL adapter implementation. 
- **[pinger](https://github.com/Neil-urk12/ping-worker)** : A simple cloudflare worker cron job that sends a get request to any server/service every minute. Update the cron job configuration in the wrangler.toml file.
